%% Boutcount 
% Boutcount is function to exact the number of bouts and duration for 
% 10 Hz sampled video that determins if activity <= 1 cm/s or > 1 cm/s 
% and assinged either a 1 or a 0. Each data entry of either 1 or 0 
% there represents a period of 100 ms when thre was either movement of 
% <= 1 cm/s (a "1" representing immobility) or > 1 cm/s (a "0" representing 
% mobility). 
%
% This function determines how many consecutive 1s or 0s there were, 
% that define a "bout" of either immobility or mobility as well as 
% how much time was sent for each bout.
